Random Password Generator in JS
This is my first JS project. 
I have added comments to make it easy to understand the code. 
I have primarily used IF, IF-ELSE and ELSE statements along with for loop.
It wil create random passwords depending on criteria the user selects.
The criterias are as below:
1) password lenght between 8 and 128 characters
2) Include Lowercase characters
3) Include Uppercase characters
4) Numeric characters
5) Special characters ( I have used limited number of password characters to keep it simple)

Once the user the has selected the criterias it will create a random password.
In addition I have also included the screenshot of the password generated after selecting all of the above criterias.
